# Neural-Network-Architecture-Optimization-Search
This is to archive a coursework, that was made as an extension of a pre-existing neural network and defined hyper-parameters as 'chromosomes'. 
The extensions done are for exploring the defined search space for 'chromosome' (i.e. hyper-parameters), which contains weight scaling between neurons, drop off, and variouspsudo-linear functions
